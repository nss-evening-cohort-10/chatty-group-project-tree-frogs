## Description
A Dark Knight themed messaging app. This project  demonstrates the authors' fluency in the use of Webpack, modules, SASS, Bootstrap, vanilla JavaScript, jQuery and HTML.

* The use of MomentJS for the creation of time stamps on messages.
* The use of dark mode, and enlarged text on key features to promote accessibility for users.
* Ability to select different users: The "username" of each user created message corresponds to the user that was selected when the message was inputted.
